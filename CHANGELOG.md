# NVIDIA Container Toolkit Changelog

## v1.17.0-rc.1
- Allow IMEX channels to be requested as volume mounts
- Fix typo in error message
- Add disable-imex-channel-creation feature flag
- Add -z,lazy to LDFLAGS
- Add imex channels to management CDI spec
- Add support to fetch current container runtime config from the command line.
- Add creation of select driver symlinks to CDI spec generation.
- Remove support for config overrides when configuring runtimes.
- Skip explicit creation of libnvidia-allocator.so.1 symlink

### Changes in the Toolkit Container

- Allow opt-in features to be selected when deploying the toolkit-container.
- Bump CUDA base image version to 12.6.2
- Remove support for config overrides when configuring runtimes.

### Changes in libnvidia-container

- Add no-create-imex-channels command line option.

## v1.16.2
- Exclude libnvidia-allocator from graphics mounts. This fixes a bug that leaks mounts when a container is started with bi-directional mount propagation.
- Use empty string for default runtime-config-override. This removes a redundant warning for runtimes (e.g. Docker) where this is not applicable.

### Changes in the Toolkit Container
- Bump CUDA base image version to 12.6.0

### Changes in libnvidia-container
- Add no-gsp-firmware command line option
- Add no-fabricmanager command line option
- Add no-persistenced command line option
- Skip directories and symlinks when mounting libraries.

## v1.16.1
- Fix bug with processing errors during CDI spec generation for MIG devices

## v1.16.0
- Promote v1.16.0-rc.2 to v1.16.0

### Changes in the Toolkit Container
- Bump CUDA base image version to 12.5.1

## v1.16.0-rc.2
- Use relative path to locate driver libraries
- Add RelativeToRoot function to Driver
- Inject additional libraries for full X11 functionality
- Extract options from default runtime if runc does not exist
- Avoid using map pointers as maps are always passed by reference
- Reduce logging for the NVIDIA Container runtime
- Fix bug in argument parsing for logger creation

## v1.16.0-rc.1

- Support vulkan ICD files directly in a driver root. This allows for the discovery of vulkan files in GKE driver installations.
- Increase priority of ld.so.conf.d config file injected into container. This ensures that injected libraries are preferred over libraries present in the container.
- Set default CDI spec permissions to 644. This fixes permission issues when using the `nvidia-ctk cdi transform` functions.
- Add `dev-root` option to `nvidia-ctk system create-device-nodes` command.
- Fix location of `libnvidia-ml.so.1` when a non-standard driver root is used. This enabled CDI spec generation when using the driver container on a host.
- Recalculate minimum required CDI spec version on save.
- Move `nvidia-ctk hook` commands to a separate `nvidia-cdi-hook` binary. The same subcommands are supported.
- Use `:` as an `nvidia-ctk config --set` list separator. This fixes a bug when trying to set config options that are lists.

- [toolkit-container] Bump CUDA base image version to 12.5.0
- [toolkit-container] Allow the path to `toolkit.pid` to be specified directly.
- [toolkit-container] Remove provenance information from image manifests.
- [toolkit-container] Add `dev-root` option when configuring the toolkit. This adds support for GKE driver installations.
